GROMACS:      gmx grompp, version 2021.4-Ubuntu-2021.4-2
Executable:   /usr/bin/gmx
Data prefix:  /usr
Working dir:  /home/cgarcia/Programs/TOREPO/example_topology/topology_and_replicate/PE_test/04-EQUILIBRATION
Command line:
  gmx grompp -f ./nvt_473K_5ns.mdp -p ../02-REPLICATE/05-PE_final_residues_noH_replicate.top -c ../03-MINIMIZATION/confout.part0001_center.gro -o new_topo.tpr -maxwarn 10


NOTE 1 [file ./nvt_473K_5ns.mdp]:
  You have set rlist larger than the interaction cut-off, but you also have
  verlet-buffer-tolerance > 0. Will set rlist using verlet-buffer-tolerance.

Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 1
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group System is 1221.00

WARNING 1 [file ./nvt_473K_5ns.mdp]:
  You are using full electrostatics treatment PME for a system without
  charges.
  This costs a lot of performance for just processing zeros, consider using
  Cut-off instead.



NOTE 2 [file ./nvt_473K_5ns.mdp]:
  The optimal PME mesh load for parallel simulations is below 0.5
  and for highly parallel simulations between 0.25 and 0.33,
  for higher performance, increase the cut-off and the PME grid spacing.
